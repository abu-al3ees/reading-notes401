## Array.map()
map() Manipulate the data from the array and set them into a new Array with the same length of orginal array also without changing the data in the original array that we send. the map calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array, in order, and constructs a new array from the results. a callback is invoked only for indexes of the array which have assigned values 


## Array.reduce()
reduce() it will reduce the all data in array to one value called accumulator the accumulator can be anything (array[],string’‘,object {}…)


## Promise
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action’s eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.



## SuperAgent
