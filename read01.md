Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness

### It takes discipline to not become “busy.”
If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for thi

“Indeed the state of all who are preoccupied is wretched, but the most wretched are those who are toiling not even at their own preoccupations…If such people want to know how short their lives are, let them reflect how small a portion is their own.”

## How to think like a programmer

### Why is this important?
Problem solving is the meta-skill.

We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.

Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):

+ Try a solution.
+ If that doesn’t work, try another one.
+ If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

Here are the steps:

1. Understand
Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).
“If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman

2. Plan
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.



3. Divide
Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.

Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.


4. Stuck?
By now, you’re probably sitting there thinking “Hey Richard... That’s cool and all, but what if I’m stuck and can’t even solve a sub-problem??”


5. Practice
Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!
