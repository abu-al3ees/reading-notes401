 ### advantages to Test Driven Development
 - Better program design and higher code quality
 - Detailed project documentation.
 - TDD reduces the time required for project development.

 ### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

 when a method needs to be run before a test and another method run after it.

### What is one downside of Test Driven Development

- No silver bullet –
Tests help to seek out bugs, but they can not find bugs that you simply introduce within the test code and in implementation code. If you haven’t understood the matter you would like to unravel, writing tests most likely doesn’t help.


- slow process –
If you begin TDD, you’ll get the sensation that you simply need an extended duration of your time for straightforward implementations. you would like to believe the interfaces, write the test code, and run the tests before you’ll finally start writing the code.

- All the members of a team got to do it –
As TDD influences the planning of code, it’s recommended that either all the members of a team use TDD or nobody in the least. additionally, to the present, it’s sometimes difficult to justify TDD to the management because they often have the sensation that the implementation of latest features takes longer if developers write code that will not find themselves within the product half the time. It helps if the entire team agrees on the importance of unit tests.


### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.


###  Why REST?

-  REST is Easy to Understand and Implement

- REST Makes your Application More Scalable

- Faster Data Interchange Format

### functional programming
 is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”

### Object-oriented programming (OOP)
 is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.


 ### classes
  Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.   


### super

The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.   

When used in a constructor, the super keyword appears alone and must be used before the this keyword is used. The super keyword can also be used to call functions on a parent object.
