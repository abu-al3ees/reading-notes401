## When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
+ Basic authentication transmits credentials as user ID/password pairs, encoded using base64. The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password.

 + Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) has security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources



## What does the JSON Web Token package do?

 JSON Web Token is used to send information that can be verified and trusted by means of a digital signature. It comprises a compact and URL-safe JSON object, which is cryptographically signed to verify its authenticity, and which can also be encrypted if the payload contains sensitive information

## What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?


- Use encryption to store secrets within .git repositories.
- Use environment variables.
- Use "Secrets as a service" solutions.



- encryption:

Encryption is the process of taking plain text, like a text message or email, and scrambling it into an unreadable format 

- token:

 authentication token allows internet users to access applications, services, websites, and application programming interfaces (APIs) without having to enter their login credentials each time they visit.

- bearer:

Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens
- secret:
 secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.

- JSON Web Token:
is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties
