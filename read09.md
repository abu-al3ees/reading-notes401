## OAuth 
is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.

OAuth doesn't share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers. OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your passwords


## how oauth works

Step 1 – The User Shows Intent.
Step 2 – The Consumer Gets Permission.
Step 3 – The User Is Redirected to the Service Provider.
Step 4 – The User Gives Permission.
Step 5 – The Consumer Obtains an Access Token.
Step 6 – The Consumer Accesses the Protected Resource.



## Integrating OAuth  into your app has several benefits:
- It allows you to read data of a user from another application.
- It supplies the authorization workflow for web, desktop applications, and mobile devices.
- Is a server side web app that uses authorization code and does not interact with user credentials
