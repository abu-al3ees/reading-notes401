## What is a Stack
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.


### Common terminology for a stack is

- Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you  attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- Top  This is the top of the stack.
- Peek  When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack.  
- When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

### Stacks follow these concepts:

- FILO
First In Last Out

## What is a Queue
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO)


### Common terminology for a queue is

- Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.



### Queues follow these concepts:

- FIFO
First In First Out
