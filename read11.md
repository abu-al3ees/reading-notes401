## Why is access control important?

Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.


## Describe an application that would need access control.
Access control is a method of guaranteeing that users are who they say they ... organizations need it the most, and the challenges security professionals can face. ... access must be dynamic and fluid, supporting identity and application-based ...


## What is a role used for?
Roles can be used for most system and object privileges

## Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

 - RBAC assigns permissions to particular roles in an organization.
-  user under RBAC may only be assigned a single role in an organization. Additionally, there is no way to provide individual users additional permissions over and above those available for their role.



## Authorization
 is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular.

## Role Based Access Control
Role Based Access Control (RBAC), also known as Non discretionary Access Control, takes more of a real world approach to structuring access control. Access under RBAC is based on a user's job function within the organization to which the computer system belongs.
## Capabilities
is the ability to perform or achieve certain actions or outcomes. As it applies to human capital, capability represents performing or achieving certain actions/outcomes in terms of the intersection of capacity and ability




## Event-Driven Programming

Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. In this article weâ€™re going to go over how Event-Driven Programming works and how we can make the best use of it in our Node.js projects.
