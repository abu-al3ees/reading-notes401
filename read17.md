## Describe “The Cloud”
The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers
## What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
 container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
## What is auto-scaling?
Auto Scaling lets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand
## What is bandwidth?
Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another within a network in a specific amount of time. It is measured in bits per second.

## How do cloud providers compute service costs?


Term
### Server Instances
 server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance
### Containers
container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing 
### Cloud Services
refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet
### Cloud Architecture
refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications
### AWS
is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offering
### EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku
Heroku is best suitable for Startups, Medium Businesses whereas AWS is mainly focused on Medium Businesses and Large Enterprises.

## What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

- The Lambda functions can perform any kind of computing task, from serving web pages and processing streams of data to calling APIs and integrating with other AWS services.

- The concept of “serverless” computing refers to not needing to maintain your own servers to run these functions. AWS Lambda is a fully managed service that takes care of all the infrastructure for you. And so “serverless” doesn’t mean that there are no servers involved: it just means that the servers, the operating systems, the network layer and the rest of the infrastructure have already been taken care of, so that you can focus on writing application code.
