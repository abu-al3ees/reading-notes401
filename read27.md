## Does a deployed React application require a server?
no not nissary
## Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
to make better UI

## What does npm run build do?
is also a cli-command predefined to run your custom scripts with the name specified in place of "command-name". So, in this case npm run build is a custom script command with the name "build" and will do anything specified inside it (for instance echo 'hello world' given in below example package. json).



### BDD
 behavior-driven development
is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers

### Acceptance Tests
testing technique performed to determine whether or not the software system has met the requirement specifications.


### build
process of converting source code files into standalone software artifacts that can be run on a computer.

## setStat

Update. State can be updated in response to event handlers, server responses or prop changes. React provides a method called setState for this purpose. setState() enqueues changes to the component state and tells React that this component and its children need to be re-rendered with the updated state.‚Äè

## Handling Events
Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

- React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

## Forms
HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state

## Controlled Components
In HTML, form elements such as input, textarea, and select typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().


## Components and Props
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation
