### Can a parent component access the state of a child component?

 we can access the child's state using Refs. we will assign a Refs for the child component in the parent component. then using Refs we can access the child's state
### What can be passed along in a prop variable?

Any information, function, JavaScript that needs to be passed.
### How can a child component “know” the state of another component?

pass the component’s state to  child components as props.



### component props
Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.

### component state
the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component

### application state

 is a state management technique. Application State is stored in the memory of the the server and is faster than storing and retrieving information in a database

### The Component Lifecycle
 it details the life of a component. Like us, components are born, do some things during their time here on earth, and then they die 
### Mounting 
is the phase in which our React component mounts on the DOM (i.e., is created and inserted into the DOM). This method is called just before a component mounts on the DOM or the render method is called. After this method, the component gets mounted.

### What even is ‘children’?
The React docs say that you can use props.children on components that represent ‘generic boxes’ and that ‘don’t know their children ahead of time’. For me, that didn’t really clear things up. I’m sure for some, that definition makes perfect sense but it didn’t for me.
