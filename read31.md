## Composition
 In React, composition is a natural pattern of the component model. It's how we build components from other components, of varying complexity and specialization through props. Depending on how generalized these components are, they can be used in building many other components
## Children / Child Components
Children allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use. ... The special thing about children is that React provides support through its ReactElement API and JSX. XML children translate perfectly to React children!


## Hash Routing
 is using the anchor part of the URL to simulate different content.


## Hooks API 
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. If you're new to Hooks, you might want to check out the overview first. 

## why hooks
Hooks apply the React philosophy (explicit data flow and composition) inside a component, rather than just between the components



## Do Hooks Make React Bloated?

If the React community embraces the Hooks proposal, it will reduce the number of concepts you need to juggle when writing React applications. Hooks let you always use functions instead of having to constantly switch between functions, classes, higher-order components, and render props.
