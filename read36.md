### What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

Cookies and local storage serve different purposes. Cookies are mainly for reading server-side, whereas local storage can only be read by the client-side . Apart from saving data, a big technical difference is the size of data you can store, and as I mentioned earlier localStorage gives you more to work with.

### Explain 3rd party cookies.
Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, you can have a "Like" button on your website which will store a cookie on a visitor's computer, that cookie can later be accessed by Facebook to identify visitors and see which websites they visited.



### How do pixel tags work?


Pixel tags are typically single pixel, transparent GIF images that are added to a web page. Even though the pixel tag is virtually invisible, it is still served just like any other image you may see online.


### cookies
 are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network
### authorization
 is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features
### access control
is a fundamental component of data security that dictates who's allowed to access and use company information and resources
### conditional rendering
In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application. Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript.


### Redux
 is a state container for JavaScript apps, often called a Redux store. It stores the whole state of the app in an immutable object tree. To create a store the createStore(reducer, initialState], enhancer]) function is used to create a new store.



Redux provides a solid, stable, and mature solution to managing state in your React application.
Through a handful of small, useful patterns, Redux can transform your application from a total mess of confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern JavaScript powerhouse.



The principles of Redux aren't new, but they are packaged and presented for you in an easy to use a library that not only elevates your applications but also improves your general understanding of building JavaScript UIs.
