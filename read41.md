It's fascinating (and depressing) to see how a few lines of code can affect the ultimate output and conclusion of a scenario.
“As developers, we are frequently on the front lines of potentially harmful and unethical practices.” This remark really struck me, and I hadn't considered it that way before, that we are one of the last people to see anything before it is out into the world.
That is something to be taken seriously, and we must continually evaluate the impact of the lines of code we are producing.
Take a stance and guarantee that our code of ethics is always present.” Another aspect of the essay that stuck out to me was the need of staying aware of what's going on and making sure we're continually thinking about what's going on. That we don't merely create lines of code as directed, but that we think about what they're doing at a higher level.

Interesting comment about re-framing big data - “Big data doesn’t have to be all that big. Rather, it’s about reconsideration of the fundamental economics of analyzing data.”
You decide what data is about the moment you define it’s schema.
“The only way to deal with this properly is to somehow link what the data is with how it can be used.”


This artical  raises a number of excellent issues, considerations, and adjustments that must be addressed in how we handle and implement data utilization.
There is dissatisfaction with how data has been managed in the past, how it is now, and how it will be managed in the future. Credit restrictions depending on where individuals buy, auto insurance based on profiles, and other instances were eye-opening.
